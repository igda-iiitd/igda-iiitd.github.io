# Welcome to the igda IIIT-D student chapter

## What is igda?

* IGDA (International Game Developers Association) is the world's largest non-profit membership-based organisation created for individuals or studios who wish to develop games.

* Visit [their official website](https://www.igda.org) for much more information!

## What are we?

* We started our journey as an unofficial club (might've known us as the Animation and Game Dev club) under Professor Anoop Ratn (who's with us here right now).

* As this unofficial club, we started experimenting and learning various tools and traits of the way, attended some game dev conferences, including the IGDA India Chapter where we met and talked with industry experts and learnt a ton of stuff.

* During the above mentioned conferences, a ton of people mentioned the integral part of programming in game dev, and since our college is knows for its programmers (apparently), we already had an edge (metaphorically). So we went ahead and started the second student chapter of IGDA in the entirety of India.

* Everyone will have a place here, if you're a beginner, we'll get you started with what excites you (if you like to draw, you'll be a concept artist. If you like to code, you could be a graphics designer. If you like to take photographs, we'll get you in on environment design/asset creation). If you already know what you're doing, or have some idea at least, we can directly jump to working on the games we've been working on.

## The (current) team

We are currently 6 members, *(maybe add a photo here)*, and our faculty coordinator Prof. Anoop Ratn

We released a recruitment form a while back and got nearly 150 applicants, which was unexpectedly high, we'll reach out to them with the next steps soon enough.

Now please allow me to introduce Prof Anoop Ratn, he's an incredible storyboardist, concept artist and animator. He has worked on some of your childhood classics like *Chhota Bheem*, *Tare zameen par*, *Star Wars: Resistance*, *Freej* and so much more.

**comes and goes**

Thank you very much sir for the incredible support you've shown towards the club and how helpful you've been.
