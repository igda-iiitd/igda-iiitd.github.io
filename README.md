# Welcome to the igda IIIT-D student chapter

## What is igda?

* IGDA (International Game Developers Association) is the world's largest non-profit membership-based organisation created for individuals or studios who wish to develop games.

* Visit [their official website](https://www.igda.org) for much more information!

## What are we?

* We started our journey as an unofficial club (might've known us as the Animation and Game Dev club) under Professor Anoop Ratn (who's with us here right now).

* As this unofficial club, we started experimenting and learning various tools and traits of the way, attended some game dev conferences, including the IGDA India Chapter where we met and talked with industry experts.
